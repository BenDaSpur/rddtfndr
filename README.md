# rddtfndr

This is a project to create a chrome extension to find reddit posts from whatever url you are currently on. Sometimes I find interesting things and want to find a reddit post to view the comments so I built this simple app to see if the url has been submitted to reddit using their API.

## Installing

```
clone repo
npm i
npm run build
```

-   Then in chrome extension settings make sure developer settings is enabled
-   add unpacked extension directory inside public directory
